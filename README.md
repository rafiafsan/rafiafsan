<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in Android development. Currently, I'm focused on honing my skills in building robust and user-friendly mobile applications. My journey began as a beginner, and I'm excited about every new challenge and learning opportunity that comes my way.
</p>

<h2>My Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> C++,C#,Python,Java,Dart</li>
  <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Android SDK, Flutter</li>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Android Studio,Visual Studio Git</li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Here are a few projects I'm proud of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Not Availabe"><strong>Music PLayer App</strong></a> Creating a music player Android app using Java involves several key steps. First, set up the project in Android Studio and add necessary permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml for reading external storage and internet access if streaming music. Design the user interface in activity_main.xml to include essential components like TextView for song titles, SeekBar for playback progress, and Button elements for play, pause, next, and previous controls. Utilize the MediaPlayer class to handle media playback, initializing it with audio files stored in the res/raw directory or external storage. Implement playback controls with onClick listeners for the buttons to manage play/pause functionality and track navigation. Ensure real-time updates of the seek bar and allow users to seek within the track. Properly manage the MediaPlayer lifecycle to handle app interruptions and release resources to prevent memory leaks. Optionally, add advanced features such as playlist management and notifications for background playback. This comprehensive approach ensures a functional and user-friendly music player app.</li>
  <li><a href="Not Available"><strong>Student Information System</strong></a> The Student Information System (SIS) web application, developed using Java, is designed to streamline the management of student data for educational institutions. It includes secure user authentication and role-based access control, enabling administrators, teachers, and students to access relevant features. Key functionalities include student registration and management, course and class scheduling, attendance tracking, and grade management. The system also features built-in communication tools for efficient messaging and notifications, as well as robust reporting and analytics to support informed decision-making. Utilizing the Spring Boot framework for backend development and integrating a relational database like MySQL with Hibernate ORM, the SIS ensures seamless data interaction and security. Enhanced with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive frontend, this application offers a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly solution for educational data management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
<p>I'm currently exploring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
As I continue to develop my skills in Android app development, I am currently focusing on several key areas to build more robust and user-friendly applications. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what Iâ€™m learning:

1. Advanced UI/UX Design:
   - Material Design: Implementing Material Design principles to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.
   - Custom Views and Animations: Creating custom views and incorporating animations to enhance user experience.

2. Architecture Components:
   - MVVM Pattern: Understanding and applying the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for better code management and separation of concerns.
   - LiveData and ViewModel: Using LiveData to handle data in a lifecycle-aware manner and ViewModel to manage UI-related data.

3. Data Persistence:
   - Room Database: Learning to use Room for local data storage, which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
   - Data Binding: Utilizing data binding to bind UI components to data sources in a declarative format.

4. Networking:
   - Retrofit: Implementing Retrofit for efficient and easy HTTP networking and API calls.
   - Coroutines and Flow: Using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous programming and handling data streams.

5. Dependency Injection:
   - Dagger/Hilt: Implementing dependency injection using Dagger and Hilt to manage dependencies and improve code modularity.

6. Testing:
   - Unit Testing and UI Testing: Writing unit tests and UI tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
   - Espresso: Using Espresso for writing concise and reliable Android UI tests.

7. Modern Android Development Practices:
   - Jetpack Compose: Exploring Jetpack Compose for building native UI components with a modern declarative approach.
   - Navigation Component: Utilizing the Navigation component for managing complex navigation flows within the app.

8. Performance Optimization:
   - Profiling Tools: Using Android Studioâ€™s profiling tools to analyze and improve the performance of the app.
   - Efficient Resource Management: Learning techniques to manage resources efficiently and reduce app latency.

9. Security:
   - Secure Data Storage: Ensuring secure data storage practices, including encryption and secure shared preferences.
   - Authentication: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms using OAuth, JWT, and biometric authentication.

10. Publishing and Distribution:
    - Google Play Store: Understanding the process of publishing apps on the Google Play Store, including compliance with policies and app store optimization (ASO).
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process.

These areas of focus are helping me build a solid foundation in Android app development, allowing me to create more efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. As I progress, I aim to integrate these skills into my projects, continuously improving and adapting to new trends and technologies in the Android ecosystem.</li>
